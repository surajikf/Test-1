# Suraj Sonnar – Portfolio

This is a simple, single-page professional portfolio site for **Suraj Sonnar**.  
It is built with plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, so it can be hosted easily on any static hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## Structure

- `index.html` – main page with all sections (Hero, About, Experience, Skills, Projects, Contact)
- `styles.css` – visual design and layout
- `script.js` – small helper script to set the current year in the footer

## How to run locally

1. Open the project folder in your file explorer.
2. Double‑click `index.html` to open it in your browser.  
   (Or right‑click → “Open with” → select your preferred browser.)

## How to customize

Open `index.html` in a code editor and search for the `TODO` comments:

- **Hero section**
  - Update your headline, short intro, and location.
  - Replace LinkedIn / GitHub links with your real URLs.
- **About section**
  - Replace the placeholder text with your background, education, and interests.
  - Fill in the quick facts card (location, role, experience, industry).
- **Experience section**
  - Duplicate the example experience block and fill in your roles, companies, dates, and bullet points.
- **Skills section**
  - Add your real technical, domain, and soft skills.
- **Projects section**
  - For each project, update the name, description, tags, and optional “View Project” link.
- **Contact section**
  - Set your real email and social links.
  - Optionally, add a link to your resume/CV.

You can also tweak colors, spacing, and layout in `styles.css` if you want a more personalized visual style.

## How to deploy (GitHub Pages example)

1. Create a new GitHub repository and push these files.
2. In your GitHub repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under “Source”, select the `main` branch and root (`/`) folder, then save.
4. After a minute, GitHub will give you a public URL where your portfolio is live.

You can then share that URL on your LinkedIn, resume, and other profiles.
